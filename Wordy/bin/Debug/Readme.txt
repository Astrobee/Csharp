................................................................PLAYER NAME.............................................................................
After choosing a level you would have to enter a player name in order to play the game.
Player names must not be less than four(4) characters long and must contain NO spaces,
which implies only a single name can be provided.


...................................................................POINTS GAINING AND TIMING..............................................................
A word generated is awarded points based on the individual characters' place of value on
the English Alphabet letters with A=1 and Z=26. Character values are summed up and given
as points gained. If word generated is wrong, the sum of the characters is subtracted from
the points you already have.

The Game starts with a maximum time of 250seconds on the clock which decreases to zero with 
a second interval. Seconds are awarded or added to the time for each correct word formed.

--Seconds are deducted or added based on the length of the word formed.


................................................................BUYING OF TIME OR WORDS................................................................
--You can buy time or new words with points you have available
As been displayed on the game window(either to the left or right), each item you wanna
buy has it required points at the top. So lets say you wanna buy 1w(1word), then 300points
